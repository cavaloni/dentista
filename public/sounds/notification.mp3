# Placeholder for notification sound file

Please replace this file with an actual MP3 sound file.

You can use any short notification sound (1-3 seconds). Recommended sources:
- Free sound websites like Freesound.org
- System notification sounds
- Simple beep/ting sounds

The sound should be professional and not too jarring for a medical practice environment.

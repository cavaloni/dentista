# Sound File

Add a notification sound file at `/public/sounds/notification.mp3`.

You can use any short notification sound (1-3 seconds) that will play when a booking is accepted.

For example, you can:
1. Use a free sound from sites like Freesound.org
2. Create a simple beep/ting sound
3. Use a system notification sound

The sound should be:
- MP3 format
- Short (1-3 seconds)
- Not too loud or jarring
- Professional sounding for a medical practice
